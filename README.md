# Drum Machine

This project is a drum machine that allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on drum pads or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

## Project Description

This drum machine fulfills the following user stories:

- **User Story #1**: There is an outer container with the ID "drum-machine" that contains all other elements.
- **User Story #2**: Within the "drum-machine", there is an element with the ID "display".
- **User Story #3**: Within the "drum-machine", there are 9 clickable drum pad elements, each with a class name of "drum-pad", a unique ID corresponding to the audio clip it triggers, and inner text corresponding to one of the following keys on the keyboard: Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C.
- **User Story #4**: Each "drum-pad" contains an HTML5 audio element with a src attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of "clip", and an ID corresponding to the inner text of its parent "drum-pad".
- **User Story #5**: Clicking on a "drum-pad" element triggers the audio clip contained in its child audio element.
- **User Story #6**: Pressing the trigger key associated with each "drum-pad" triggers the audio clip contained in its child audio element.
- **User Story #7**: When a "drum-pad" is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the "#display" element.
